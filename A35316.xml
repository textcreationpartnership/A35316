            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CUrteous Reader, this ſecond Edition of my book of <hi>Cavallrie</hi> coming forth without my knowledge, I was diſappointed of my purpoſe of inſerting ſome alterations and additions in their due places: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (to ſatisfie the commanding requeſts of ſome Friends) I ſhall give a touch of ſome ſudden obſervations, which you may pleaſe to referre to their ſeverall Chapters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. Experience having taught later times that the allowing of Bidets (or Nagges) to the Horſemen, cauſed a great expenſe of forrage, and a needleſſe conſumption of victuall, and great diſorders by reaſon of their boyes; they are not now allowed any naggs, neither in the Armie of the States of the united Provinces, nor in divers other places.</p>
            <p>And touching the Captains libertie to chooſe their own Officers, that is alſo altered: for the Generall now gives Commiſſions to the Lieutenant and Cornet as well as to the Captain; yet (in way of favour) the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doth oftentimes admit of ſuch Officers as are nominated and preſented to him by the Captain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. We being now fallen into times of Action, and the knowledge of the pay allowed to every Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and Souldier being ſo generally neceſſary, I have thought fit to communicate an Eſtabliſhment, being that which is at preſent uſed: And though I intended onely to ſpeak of ſo much as concerneth the Horſe; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great concernment for the Foot and Train of Artillerie, I ſhall make bold to digreſſe a little, and give you a brief and ſummarie liſt of all, as followeth.</p>

The horſeman (having ſpanned his piſtol) is not to return his ſpanner to the ſide of his Caſe (where ſome would have it) for there it is neither ſure nor readily returned: but is to wear it in a ſtring hanging on his left ſhoulder, by his right ſide. And for lading his Piſtols (and ſo for the Carbine) I would (by no means) have him to uſe his flask, but the (farre readier) way of Cartouches, which his Holſters muſt alwayes be furniſhed with, beſides thoſe which he is to have in ſtore.</p>

To this end, the Officers muſt be very carefull to exerciſe their Troops frequently, eſpecially in a regimentall way (as the ſole means, under God, to make them victorious) obſerving to keep their Troops cloſe ſerried; to leave fit diſtances between each Troop, Regiment, and Brigade; to relieve each other orderly; to retreat (upon occaſion) in due order into their appointed intervalls, and to avoid confuſion.</p>

                  <p>IT is neceſſary, that the Lieutenant of a troop of horſe be a man of abilitie and experience, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and educated in Cavallrie.

Upon occaſion of fight he is ſtill to be on the rear with his ſword drawn, encouraging the ſouldiers, and killing any that ſhall offer to flie or disband: but in caſe of the Captains abſence, he ſhall take the Captains place, appointing an officer to be in the rear.

                  <p>The company going to the guard in any place, and approching near it, the Lieutenant goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take notice of the Corps-du-guard, and ſpeaking with the Lieutenant of the company which is to change, informeth himſelf by him of the place, of the ſentinells for day and night, what wayes he muſt ſcoure, and of all other things requiſite. He muſt himſelf go and place the ſentinells, viſiting them often, and uſing all diligence, keeping himſelf alwayes armed, (at leaſt with the breaſt and cask) and his horſe bridled, when he hath the guard.</p>
                  <p>The company being lodged in ſome village, he muſt cauſe the billets to be ſigned by the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaſter of his company, to be diſtributed to the ſouldiers before the Cornets lodging, where the Alto is made to attend the ſaid billets; that ſo (in caſe of an allarm) the ſouldiers may know where to aſſemble together at their Cornet.</p>
                  <p>If they ſtay longer then a day in one place, the Lieutenant is to viſit the houſes, to ſee good rule kept by the ſouldiers; and being to march away, to command them carefully to put out their fires.

Alſo about taking and ranſoming of priſoners. <hi>ibid.</hi>

                     </note> bootie (whether it be given by occaſion of defeating the enemie, or going out upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c.) is free to them that take it, whether they be priſoners, or any thing elſe, the Lord Generall being in the field. But otherwiſe, it is to be ſhared among them that were employed in the action.</p>
                  <p>One part is for the Infanterie, and two for the Cavallrie: and it is death to him that ſhall let go any priſoner, or horſe, or other bootie, or ſhall uſe any fraud whatſoever: and they that ſhall not diſcover it (knowing of any ſuch deceit) ſhall looſe their ſhares. The Captains, being preſent at the taking of bootie, uſe to have five ſhares, and two for two pages. The Lieutenants three, and the Cornets two, and either of them one for a page. But of later times the Captains take ten parts, the Lieutenants ſix, the Cornets foure, according to the places which they have in forage.</p>
                  <p>The bootie being reparted, every companie giveth 10. <hi>per centum</hi> to their Captain of what is gotten, though he were not preſent: to the chief of the troop (though but a private ſouldier) two parts, and ſo to the guides.</p>
                  <p>All the bootie being brought together, they chooſe two of the diſcreeteſt ſouldiers to cauſe the bootie to be ſold: theſe keep account of the money taken for it, certifying the Chief thereof, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40349:11"/> ordereth to every man his due proportion. The Trumpets muſt have leave of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the place to ſell the ſaid bootie, and the buyer is to give one of every twentie to the trumpeter, for his pains in the ſale: which money is to be divided among the trumpeters which were employed in the taking of that bootie; they having no other ſhare.</p>
                  <p>If one or more horſes were hurt or killed in the combat; or any ſouldiers chanced to be hurt in the ſaid action, thoſe horſes muſt be made good, and the ſouldiers are to be recompenſed, before the bootie be divided, at the diſcretion of the Chief.</p>
                  <p>If any ſouldiers horſe fall lame, after the troop be marched a good diſtance from the quarter, ſo as he be forced to return back, yet ſhall that ſouldier have his ſhare of the bootie, as if he had been preſent at the taking thereof.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, concerning the taking of priſoners, becauſe other authours are ſcant in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it will not be amiſſe (for the better ſatisfaction of ſuch as are not acquainted with that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) to adde ſomething out of the States edict, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Every ſouldier (of what condition ſoever he be) ſhall forthwith, and before evening,<note place="margin">Artic. 59.</note> bring all ſuch of the enemie as are taken priſoners before him, which commandeth in the quarter; upon pain of looſing his priſoner, and being puniſhed with death.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſhould take ſome eminent officer, or commander of the enemie priſoner,<note place="margin">60.</note> or other perſon of qualitie; they ſhall be bound to preſent the ſame (or cauſe him to be preſented and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered) immediately to the Lords the States Generall, or the Councel of State, receiving for them (as alſo for other priſoners which the ſaid States ſhall take to themſelves) ſome reaſonable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, according to the qualitie or abilitie of the ſaid priſoners; yet not exceeding the ſumme of 500. pounds, whereby the ſaid priſoner ſhall remain at the diſpoſing of the ſaid States: and they which took him, ought to have no further pretence to him.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall not be lawfull for any man to cauſe a priſoner to be killed, or ſet at ranſom:<note place="margin">61.</note> nor (after ranſom be paid) to ſuffer him to depart, without leave of the Generall, or of him that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the quarter, on pain of being diſarmed, and baniſhed out of the provinces.</p>
                  <p>And if any priſoner be found to walk about the leaguer or place of garriſon,<note place="margin">62.</note> without leave of the Generall or Commander in that quarter or garriſon; the partie which had taken him ſhall forfeit his ſaid priſoner, to the profit of him who firſt ſhall apprehend the ſaid priſoner.</p>
                  <p>All lawfull booties are to be certified by the takers thereof, to the Commander of the quarter within three houres after their arrivall; and are to be regiſtred, and ſold in the open market, &amp;c. upon pains of forfeiture, and of corporall puniſhment, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of ſupplying the Cavallrie with good horſes.</head>
                  <p>FOr the reforming of the Cavallrie, there is moreover required a ſingular care, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies be ſupplied with good horſes: wherefore it will be neceſſarie, that when the Cavallrie is retired from the field, the Captains make ſale of ſuch horſes as be unfit for ſervice, and buy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When the companies be entered into garriſon, the ſouldiers which are on foot muſt preſently be remounted; that ſo, in the time of winter, they may at leiſure fit their horſes for ſervice: for being onely remounted at the time of their going into the field, the<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Equos aſſiduo labore convenit edomari.</hi> Veg. lib. 2. cap. 14.</note> horſes are not fitted for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and being young and not uſed to the bridle, by any little toil they become unprofitable: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when a man is put (on the ſudden) to buy ſuch as he findeth, they prove not onely the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, but the dearer. Moreover, thoſe ſouldiers which want horſes are of no ſervice; and theſe are they (uſually) which ſtraggle disbanded, and do moſt miſchief about the quarters. And becauſe oftentimes there is not money aſſigned apart to remount the ſouldiers, it were good that among the companies there were a brother-hood or fellowſhip erected, (which the Spaniſh call <hi>Platta</hi>) which conſiſteth in making a caſh, wherein the money which is gathered to that end, is kept; as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Firſt, the ſouldiers of every companie chooſe foure of their moſt judicious fellows, with conſent of the captain. Theſe, with the farrier of the companie, muſt view all the horſes of their companie, prizing every one according to his value, and concealing it from the ſouldiers, to avoid diſputes: and of this prizing they muſt keep a record, that ſo, if any horſe happen to die, it may be known what is to be allowed; provided alwayes, that they go no higher then 50. crowns. To raiſe this caſh, the Captain muſt give order that a crown be defalked out of every ſouldiers firſt pay, foure realls out of a third pay, and eight out of the contributions of a moneth: or elſe this proportion to be for the firſt beginning, and afterwards the moitie; or more or leſſe as need ſhall require,</p>
                  <p>Every horſe dying in ſervice, or by miſchance, without the ſouldiers fault, ſhall be made good to the ſouldier that loſt him.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of Exerciſing in particular. Of managing of the horſe and arms.</head>
                  <p>THe Cavallrie being to be exerciſed, muſt be inſtructed how to manage their horſe and their arms.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the horſe (preſuppoſing him to be of ſufficient ſtature and ſtrength, nimble of joynts, and ſure of foot, &amp;c.) he muſt (of neceſſitie) be made fit for ſervice, ſo as you may have him ready at command to pace, trot, gallop, or run in full career; alſo to advance, ſtop, retire, and turn readily to either hand, and all with alacritie and obedience. Now, to bring him to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die turning, he is to be ridden the ring, and figure 8, firſt in a great compaſſe, and ſo in a leſſe by degrees, firſt upon his pace, then on the trot, and ſo to the gallop and career. Theſe things he may be taught by uſing the hand, leg, and voice. For the hand (obſerving not to move the arm,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40349:14"/> but onely the wriſt) if you would have him to face to the left, a little motion of the little finger on that rein, and a touch of the left leg (without uſing the ſpurre) doth it: if to face (or turn) to the left about, a harder, &amp;c. If you would have him to trot, you are to move both your legs a little forward; for the gallop, to move them more forward; and for the career to yerk them moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to move the bodie a little forward with it. After every motion performed, it were good to keep him a while in that motion, as when you bid him ſtand, to ſtand a while, &amp;c. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it were not amiſſe, after every thing well done, to give him ſome bread or graſſe as a rewards For the voice, you may uſe the words, Advance, hold, turn, or the like; but becauſe the voice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwayes be heard, it were good to uſe him chiefly to the motions of the hand and leg. It will alſo be very uſefull to teach him to go ſidewayes: this he may be brought unto by laying his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender ſomewhat farre from him in the manger, and keeping him from turning his head towards it. He muſt alſo be uſed to the ſmell of gunpowder, the ſight of fire and armour, and the bearing of ſhot, drummes and trumpets, &amp;c. but by degrees and with diſcretion. When he is at his oats (at a good diſtance from him) a little powder may be fired, and ſo nearer to him by degrees. So may a piſtoll be fired ſome diſtance off, and ſo nearer: in like manner a drum or trumpet may be uſed. The groom may ſometime dreſſe him in armour, and he may be uſed (now and then) to eat his oats from the drum head. It will be very uſefull ſometime to cauſe a musketier to ſtand at a convenient diſtance, and both of you to give fire upon each other, and thereupon to ride up cloſe to him: alſo to ride him againſt a compleat armour, ſo ſet upon a ſtake, that he may overthrow it, and trample it under his feet: that ſo (and by ſuch other means) your horſe (finding that he receiveth no hurt) may become bold to approch any object. He may alſo be uſed to mountanous and uneven wayes, and be exerciſed to leap, ſwim, and the like. But for further directions for the art of riding and managing the horſe.

                  <p>The manner of carrying the lance, is either advanced, or couched; that is, when it is carried ſo abaſed, as the enemie can hardly diſcover it untill he feel the ſhock.</p>
                  <p>The charging of the lance is twofold, either by the right, or left.</p>
                  <p>The right is, when it is preſented or charged along by the right ſide of the horſe.</p>
                  <p>The left is, when it is born acroſſe the neck of the horſe, by the left eare.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the manner uſed by the Turks and Hungarians, and by ſome prefered before the other. One reaſon which they give for it, is, becauſe that in charging by the left, the Lancier muſt incline his bodie to the left, and ſo ſitteth the leſſe ſure in his ſaddle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Basta</hi> would have the ſecond way to be beſt. Howſoever, all agree that a Lancier muſt ever ſtrive to gain the left ſide of his enemie, and charge him on the left.</p>
                  <p>Now there be three wayes of charging;
<list>
                        <item>1 By carrying the lance ſloaped upwards.</item>
                        <item>2 By charging it levell, in a ſtraight line.</item>
                        <item>3 By charging it ſloaping, or inclining downwards.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is, if againſt Cavallrie, to take the ſight of the enemie with the point of the lance; or, if againſt foot, the head or neck of either pike or musketier.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, by charging a horſe-man about the middle, (to bear him out of the ſaddle) or on the breaſt of the foot.</p>
                  <p>The third ſerveth to pierce the breaſt of the enemies horſe, or a kneeling musketier, or pike charging at the foot againſt horſe.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Having given his charge with the lance, ſo as it becometh unuſefull to him, he muſt betake himſelf to his piſtoll, in the uſe whereof he is to be very skilfull. His laſt refuge is his ſword, which he muſt alſo be well practiſed in. Of both which weapons ſhall be ſpoken in the next chapter.</p>

                  <p>But the more compendious way of lading, for the gaining of time (which in the inſtant of skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh is chiefly to be regarded) is by uſing cartouches. Now, the cartouch is to be made of white paper, cut out of convenient breadth and length, and rolled upon a ſtick, (or the rammer, if it be not too little) fit (according to the bore of the barrell) to contain a due quantity of powder, and the bullet. The proportion of powder uſually required is half the weight of the bullet; but that is held too much by ſuch as can judge. Having moulded the paper, the one end of it is to be turned in, (to keep in the powder) and the due charge of powder to be put into it at the other end; which powder is to be cloſed in by tying a little thred about the paper: then the bullet is to be put in, and that alſo tied in with a little thred. When the Cuiraſſier is to uſe his cartouch, he muſt bite off the paper at the head of it, and ſo put it into the barrell of his piſtol, with the bullet upward, and then ramme it home. By<note n="b" place="margin">For the more ſpeedy lading of the piſtol, and avoiding the trouble of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either flaſque or touch-box, there is a late invented faſhion of ſpanner or key, (which I have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>figure</hi> 1.) which contains ſix charges of powder (at the leaſt) and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming powder ſufficient for thoſe charges, and for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the piſtol caſes be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which the Cuiraſſier will find to be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good uſe, when he is uſed thereunto.</note> this means he ſhall much expedite the lading of his piſtol.

                  <p>To exerciſe the horſe, they are to be drawn up into a body, not by ranks, but by files; and thoſe of five deep, as moſt affirm; or of ſix, as others would have it: and that becauſe the number of five is not diviſible by two, and ſo in doubling of ranks, or half files, or the like, there is alwayes an odde rank. Some would have them (eſpecially the harquebuſiers) to be eight in file, taking the troop to conſiſt of 64. Being put in <hi>Battalia,</hi> that is, ordered into a ſquare body, and ſilence ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded; the firſt thing to be taught them, is diſtance. And herein authors diſagree. Some make cloſe order to be two paces; open order, foure paces; and ſo for double, triple, and quadruple diſtance proportionable. Others make but two kinds of diſtances; cloſe order, which is three foot; and open order, which is ſix foot. But this muſt be underſtood <hi>cum grano ſalis,</hi> (as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians ſpeak:) for here we muſt obſerve a difference between the manner of taking the diſtance of the Cavallrie, and that of the Infantery: for in the foot, the diſtance is taken from the centre of the ſouldiers body, which here cannot be ſo underſtood, but onely of the ſpace of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween horſe and horſe.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Praiſſac</hi> is more plain, who would have the diſtance between rank and rank (both for the length of the horſe, as alſo for the ſpace between horſe and horſe) to be ſix paces, and one pace between file and file. Yet, if we take every pace for five foot (as that is the uſuall dimenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) by this rule they ſhould be at a very large diſtance.</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, the Cavallrie being to be exerciſed in their motions, ſhould be at their diſtance of ſix foot, or open order (taking it as hath been ſhewed)<note n="b" place="margin">Omnes milites incedendi ordinem ſervent, <hi>Veg. 1. 9.</hi> Vt aequali legui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>móque ſpatio mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les diſtet a milite; nec ultrà quàm expedit aut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globent agmen aut laxent. <hi>Ibid. cap. 26.</hi>

                  <p>The uſe of facings is to make the company perfect, to be ſuddenly prepared for a charge on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flank or the rear.</p>

                  <p>Countermarches ſerve, either to reduce the file-leaders into the place of the bringers up; and ſo to have the beſt men ready to receive the charge of an enemy in the rear; or to bring one flank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of the other: or front, and rear, or either flank into the middle of the body.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of wheelings, is to bring the front (which is alwayes ſuppoſed to conſiſt of the ableſt men) to be ready to receive the charge of the enemy on either flank or rear.</p>
                  <p>Theſe motions (for the more eaſie apprehenſion of the untutored ſouldier) are repreſented in figures, by a company of harquebuſiers of 64 men. And therein the file-leaders and bringers up are diſtinguiſhed by a differing letter, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>UPon occaſion of marching with all or part of the Cavallrie by night, the companies are punctually appointed their places of march by written orders delivered to their officers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the troops, a Corporall with 12 or 15 Harquebuſiers is to be ſent, by the ſpace of half a league, to diſcover and take intelligence at the houſes, whether there be any news of the enemie. And paſſing by places which are at the enemies devotion, ſome of them muſt have the language, and feigne themſelves friends, the better to know what paſſeth.</p>
                  <p>Not long after theſe, foure others are to follow, as in the former chapter. Beſides, a choſen troop of Cuiraſſiers are to be ready, led by a Captain of ſpeciall deſert, with order to<note n="a" place="margin">Capienda rebus in malis praeceps via eſt. <hi>Seneca.</hi>
                     </note> charge reſolutely upon any adverſarie; and theſe are to march 150 paces before the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The chief Commander is to march at the head of the firſt troop which followeth the ſaid cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen troop of 60 Cuiraſſiers, and with him one of the beſt ſouldiers of every troop, to carrie the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (upon all occaſions) to their Captains: ſending before him foure of his ableſt men, to give him notice if the ſaid ſelect troop of 60 Cuiraſſiers charge the enemie: which if it happen, he ſhall caſt his companie out of the way, and charge the enemie on the flank; and ſo the reſt of the troops, obſerving that they intermix not their troops.</p>
                  <p>The troops muſt not leave ſuch diſtances between each other as in the day march, unleſſe they heare news of the enemies approch.<note n="b" place="margin">Progredientes viam faciunt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio &amp; quietè, decenter omnes proprium ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aſſervantes. <hi>Joſephus, of the Romanes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cited by</hi> Lipſius de milit.

If together in one village, and in the night, (when the enemy may come upon them the more at unaware, as not being diſcoverable very farre) then this place muſt not be in the front of the village, as being too near the enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, whereby it might be ſeiſed on by him, and ſo your men cut off one after another as they come thither to aſſemble themſelves: but it muſt be on the ſides or flanks of the village, though the baggage be hazarded; which<note n="a" place="margin">This all ages have verified. The States men (by a ſtratagem) had ſurpriſed S. <hi>Hertogen-Boſh, anno</hi> 1585. but by reaſon of the covetouſneſſe of the ſouldiers (neglecting their charges to fall to pillaging) were beaten out again with loſſe. <hi>Meteren. lib.</hi> 12.</note> inviting the enemy to pillaging, often giveth him occaſion of diſorder. But in the day time it were beſt to be in front, ſhewing the more courage.</p>
                  <p>If the Cavallrie be quartered in diverſe villages (which often happeneth, eſpecially in places little ſuſpected) the quality of the countrey muſt be conſidered. Some villages may be backed with rivers, and ſo give but one entrance to the enemie: then the generall place of arms or rendez-vous ſhall be in the center. And thoſe villages which are expoſed to the firſt brunt, ſhall be as Corps-du-guards to aſſure the reſt. Theſe (upon alarm given) muſt aſſemble in their particular alarm places, from thence they ſhall advance, united to receive the charge, though the enemy farre exceed them in number: and muſt ſuſtain him ſo long, till they may be aſſured that the reſt are all met at the generall Rendez-vous, whether (being forced by the enemy) they ſhall retreat by little and little, the other advancing to relieve them. If the countrey be open, ſo as the enemy may aſſail which he pleaſe, then they muſt uſe thoſe diligences as when the Cavallrie is lodged altogether in one village. They which are firſt aſſaulted muſt make reſiſtance, untill the other be met at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rendez-vous.</p>
                  <p>Touching the order of their aſſembling together in the alarm place, the Commiſſary Generall, or Quartermaſter Generall, overnight appointeth a certain place for every troop, where they ſhall ſtand, which way faced, &amp;c.</p>

The Corps-du-guard muſt be in the middle of the village. The guards, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed in their places, muſt be every night viſited by the Commiſſary Generall (which often the Lieutenant Generall, and ſometime the Generall himſelf ought to do) to keep the ſouldiers in the greater aw. The Generalls company is exempt from the ordinary guards and convoyes, becauſe they muſt be a guard to the Generall, (unleſſe the Generall go in perſon) and ſo is the Lieutenant Generalls company.</p>
                  <p>The companies entring the guard, muſt be compleatly armed, and ſound their trumpets; their Lieutenant taking information of all things from the Lieutenant which goeth from the guard, and then certifying his Captain; who is to acquaint his ſuperiour officers with all occurrences, and with the reports of ſuch as went to diſcover and ſcowre the high-wayes, alſo of the convoyes and other duties.</p>
                  <p>If the Cavallrie lodge in ſeverall villages (which ever muſt not be farre diſtant from each other) in every village a company muſt have the guard and Sentinells.</p>

                  <p>In the day time, if there be any open champain within half a league (or thereabout) of the quarter, the company which hath the guard ſhall ſend out a Corporall with twelve or fifteen horſe, which ſhall hide himſelf in ſome covert place near the entrance of the ſaid champain. There he ſhall place double Sentinells in ſome eminent place, who ſeeing ſome Cavallry, one ſhall go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry them, the other ſhall go and tell the Corporall; who ſending word to the Corps-du-guard, ſhall advance at large, ſending out two horſes to take knowledge of the ſaid Cavallry. If there be

Theſe horſe ſhall be changed (or relieved) twice a day, by thoſe which have the guard. If the enemy charge them, they are to retreat to the ſaid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and there to entertain the enemy till they of the guard can be ready (upon the former no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given them) and come to ſecond them.</p>
                  <p>If all the Cavallry go to oppoſe the enemy, the Captain of the guard ſhall have the vanguard. If more companies then one be employed for guard, that company ſhall have it, near which the alarm was given.</p>
                  <p>Sometime it ſo happeneth as that the troops come to their quarter in the night and in ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as the advenues cannot be obſerved, nor fitting places for the guards nor Sentinels: Then the Commiſſary Generall (or the Generall himſelf) is to go and appoint them as he ſhall judge moſt convenient: appointing to every company ten ſouldiers of guard, (more or leſſe as need ſhall require) and commanding all to be in readineſſe, giving order to the Corps-du-guard (as the onely remedy) that if the enemy aſſail the quarter, they go reſolutely and charge him: which (beſides the honour and reputation ſo gotten) oftentimes proveth<note n="c" place="margin">Audaces fortis na juvas.</note> fortunate.

                  <p>Alarms (though falſe) cannot be prevented, it being in the enemies choice to ſhew himſelf as often as he pleaſe, happily for no other intent but to wearie your ſouldiers; or by that ſtratagem to make them ſecure and careleſſe. To remedie this, the Captains uſe to give the alarm ſecretly (without ſound or noiſe) by ſilent advices; that ſo the enemie vaunt not of putting you to trouble, but wearie himſelf. And thus the horrour of the ſounds of trumpets and noiſe of warlike cries is avoided, which hinder the hearing of the Commanders directions. But if the enemie charge the ſaid Diſcoverers or Sentinells ſo hard, as that they have no opportunitie to ſend word, but the enemie puts on to enter the quarter with them (which is the beſt way for him to compaſſe his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) then they ſhall (flying to the quarter) give the alarm with firings of the Harquebuſiers and calling out aloud, entering not at the uſuall wayes, but at the private ones; to give the enemie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuſpence, not knowing whither they might draw him on. Moreover, when the alarm is thus ſecretly given (as before ſhewed) and having ſome notice of the enemies forces how ſtrong they are in number, you may cauſe your ſouldiers to mount with all poſſible ſecrecie, and order them for fight, on the flank of the enemies advenue, leaving the Sentinels (with ſome trumpets) there ſtanding, with command that, when the enemie approcheth them, they ſhall<note n="b" place="margin">Such a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem was uſed by Sir <hi>Fran.

The enemie gave 3 ſhouts (as the Spaniſh manner is when they go to charge) but could neither ſee nor be ſeen by reaſon of the winding of the way in the wood. Upon this he commanded the Drums and Trumpets to ſtand, and ſound a charge: whereat the enemie made a ſtand, expecting to be charged; which gave time for all the troops to get into the plain, by haſtening their march. <hi>Manuſcript</hi> penned by Sir <hi>Fran.

The firſt (entring without reſiſtance) will be ſcattered about the houſes; the reſt will haſten to get their ſhares: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Captains do, they ſhall not be able to keep them in ſuch order as they ought.

                  </head>
                  <p>FOrraging is an action of great importance and danger. 1. Of importance, becauſe thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth the ſuſtenance of the horſes. 2. Of danger, by reaſon of<note n="a" place="margin">Hostes qui lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gè à ſuis aut pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli, aut praedae gratiâ commoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſubitò occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandi cum dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 10.</hi>
                     </note> the enemies endeavours to ſet upon the guards and convoyes of forragers, which muſt be ſent out at leaſt twice a week. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that theſe forragers may the better be ſecured, there muſt alwayes be a good groſſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanterie and Cavallrie ſent with them, under the command of a chief officer, or at leaſt a well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Captain. The Provoſt or one of his aſſiſtants is to go with them, to puniſh ſuch as are exorbitant or ſtraggle. If the forrage be for the whole armie, the Lieutenant Generall is to leade the convoy.<note n="b" place="margin">Pugnatores ab impedimentis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamento aliquo dividuntur, nè conſtipati laedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in praelio, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulante exercitu. <hi>Ibid. cap. 6.</hi>
                     </note> The baggage nor horſe-boyes muſt be mingled among the troops.</p>
                  <p>It is not fit to go twice together to one place to forrage, leſt the enemie knowing it, watch an opportunitie. At firſt it is good to forrage in the moſt remote places, and where the enemie is like to come to encamp: but if the enemie be ſettled, it is not good to forrage ſo near him as that he might ſet upon the convoy with Infanterie and Cavallrie; but rather in ſuch places, where he can hardly (without great danger to himſelf) endammage the forragers.<note n="c" place="margin">

The horſe are to place a Sentinell, and to ſend out two to diſcover the wayes a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before them. By this means the forragers having finiſhed their forraging, make their retreat ſafely; to which purpoſe alſo one or two troops of twentie five horſe apiece uſe to march upon the flanks of the forragers. When all the forragers are marching back again towards the quarter, all the convoy marcheth in the rear; it being unlikely that the enemie will ſet upon them with any great forces between their convoy and their quarter.</p>

It is good to appoint them their ordinary ſettled garriſons, that ſo they may there leave their baggage, and go into the field with the leſſe incumbrance; which will alſo make them the better skilled in the knowledge of the countrey and wayes. If there be one troop or more of horſe laid in garriſon in ſome walled citie where the horſe make no guard, the Captain of each troop muſt alwayes keep one of his ſouldiers in the Corps-du-guard of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to give him notice of all occurrences, of the enemies approches, alarms, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is fit that a troop of horſe having a frontier citie for their garriſon, ſhould keep fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen horſe upon the guard; if there be more companie, then twentie five at leaſt, to be preſently readie upon all occaſions, while the reſt can prepare themſelves.

But this diligence of keeping the horſe at the Corps-du-guard is not of neceſſitie in ſuch garriſons which lie within the countrey, where there is no fear of ſurpriſes, or ſcaladoes.</p>

For which purpoſe it behoveth him to have good ſpies, which muſt be exceeding well rewarded, that ſo they may be the readier to expoſe themſelves to all dangers. The beſt and moſt aſſured ſpies are ones own ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which (feigning ſome diſcontent for want of pay, or otherwiſe) enter into the enemies ſervice, and get themſelves into the Cavallry, as having beſt opportunity (whether in the field or in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon) to give information. Of theſe it is good to have many, and in ſeverall places, the one knowing nothing of the other. You are to agree with them of the place where they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey their letters, as ſome tree, gallows, or other place eaſie to find, where they alſo ſhall find yours giving them order to come in perſon when their advice is of great importance: as, if the enemy would fall upon a quarter, ſurpriſe ſome place, or attempt ſome other great enterpriſe. There
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40349:27"/> might alſo divers ſouldiers be daily ſent diſguiſed, under ſeverall pretences, to obſerve what is done in the enemies leaguer, when it is near. The boors uſe alſo to ſerve for ſpies, aſwell women as men, which, being not much regarded nor ſuſpected, may have the freer acceſſe: but theſe are not alwayes to be truſted, neither are they ſo well able to judge of or to pierce into buſineſſe, and the leſſe aſſurance and information is to be had by their relations.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſpies which are called double, which muſt be men of great fidelity. Theſe (to get credit with the enemy) muſt ſometimes give him true information of what paſſeth on the other ſide; but of ſuch things, and at ſuch times, as they may do no hurt. But theſe kind of ſpies cannot continue long without being diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>If it be poſſible, ſuch ſpies muſt be had, as are entertained into domeſticall ſervice of the chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and deſignes.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, there muſt be exceeding great care taken to beware of the enemies ſpies, which otherwiſe may do you as much miſchief as you reap benefit by your own. To remedy this inconvenience,</p>

                     </note> no better way then to aſſail him in his quarter.

                  <p>If he cannot (by other means) get knowledge how their guards are kept, and other duties either obſerved or neglected; he may conjecture by the<note n="b" place="margin">Ad rem perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net qualis ipſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarius vel ejus comites ſint, nôſſe: utrùm temerarii an cauti; audaces, an timidi; ſcuntes artem bellicam, an ex uſu temerè pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnantes, &amp;c. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 9.</hi>

                  <p>In the aſſailing of his quarter, there are two things to be obſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To make your approches as near the village as poſſible may be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note n="c" place="margin">In campis ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, atque ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, opportunum pralium infertur, exceptis ſuperven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus vel incurſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus repentinis ex occaſione, quam nunquam dux exercitatus amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit. <hi>Veg. l. 3. c. 19.</hi>
                     </note> To hinder him from uniting his troops into a body.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, the firſt troop ſhall advance (without any forerunners) as ſecretly as may be: and aſſoon as they perceive themſelves to be diſcovered (without loſing a moment of time)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40349:28"/> ſhall charge the Sentinells, and enter the quarter with them, and ſurpriſe the Corps-du-guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be able to mount on horſe-back.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, there muſt be an exquiſite obſervance of the orders given, and not a man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Suppoſe the enemy hath 1000. horſe and you but 500, you may fitly divide your forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to five troops. The firſt having ſurpriſed the Corps-du-guard (as before mentioned) ſhall from thence paſſe to the market-place, with reſolution to ſuſtain any reſiſtance which they ſhall meet with. The ſecond troop (perceiving the quarter inveſted) ſhall follow upon the gallop cloſely united, and finding no reſiſtance, ſhall poſſeſſe the alarm place, and ſend ſome horſe to run through the ſtreets, to keep the ſouldiers in; and to hinder them from mounting on horſeback.</p>
                  <p>The third ſhall come fairly on to the ſaid place, and ſo the fourth; which (leaving the third there firm) ſhall haſten to the place where they heare the moſt noiſe: then ſhall they alight and enter the houſes, putting to the ſword what enemies they find. The running of theſe horſe through the ſtreets, hindering the ſouldiers to mount, will ſurely make them think rather<note n="d" place="margin">Nec inſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ullum peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum est, cum victi (quibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendi poterant) arma converte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint in fugam. <hi>Ibid. cap. 21.</hi>
                     </note> of eſcaping by flight through the gardens or otherwiſe, then of reſiſting: neither can there (in ſuch a tumult) be good orders given or obſerved. Therefore the fifth troop hearing the noiſe ceaſe, may conjecture there is no need of their help to take the village; and ſo ſhall divide themſelves into two parts, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the quarter on the outſide, to hinder the enemies flight on foot. The horſe-boyes may fire a houſe or two, eſpecially where the enemy ſhall endeavour to fortifie; then (as the ſouldiers) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the houſes to pillage and take priſoners, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another way of aſſailing the quarter, is this: The enemies camp removing, the Chief or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain muſt labour to inform himſelf of the place where he purpoſeth to lodge that night; and where the quarter for the Cavallry ſhall be: which may eaſily be learned, becauſe overnight it is uſually publiſhed: or having good knowledge of the countrey, he may conjecture it. He muſt conſider the number of his enemies horſe, and of his own, and though he be inferiour by half (as beforeſaid) yet may his enterpriſe take good effect, if it be well carried. He muſt fit the time ſo<note n="e" place="margin">Nam vel cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riùs vel tardius aliquo pervenire quam conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum perſape no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum intervertit. <hi>Leo Tact. c. 15. 42.</hi>
                     </note> juſtly, as that he may come to the enemies quarter in the evening, before the guards be diſpoſed, or the orders given. And if the diſtance were ſuch, as that he muſt march when the enemy march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; he ſhall depart from his quarter with all ſecreſie, and<note n="f" place="margin">A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander (like a good wraſtler) ought to make ſhew of one thing, and to put another in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: to the end to deceive the enemy, and gain the victory. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Tutiſſimum n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And (when he thinketh fit) he ſhall face about, and march on the flank of the enemy as covertly as may be. But to do this, two things muſt be obſerved; 1. That your march be through your friends countrey. 2. That you have more then one ſpie in the enemies Cavallry, ſo as they be not able to ſtirre without your knowledge. It muſt be alſo conſidered, that if you go to aſſail your enemies quarter, he may have means to diſcover your purpoſe by his ſcouts or otherwiſe, and ſo be prepared for you: therefore muſt you have a care to be provided for it, by taking good order beforehand, and ſecuring your<note n="g" place="margin">Nam diſciplinae bellicae, &amp; exemplorum periti, nuſquam majus periculum imminere testantur, quàm in receſſu ab hoſtibus. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap 21.</hi>

                  <p>TO know rightly how to charge the enemy, is a matter of great conſequence.

The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall firſt give on with 25 horſe charging the enemie upon a full trot or gallop: him ſhall the Captain follow with the reſt of that troop.

                  <p>If you meet a troop of the enemies horſe, your ſelf having alſo but one troop, both of equall number, and that it ſo fall out that the enemy retreat; you are to ſend your Lieutenant with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty horſe to charge him in the rear, following him with fifty to the ſame effect, cloſed as firm as may be: the reſt muſt follow at a good diſtance under a good Corporall, which ſhall not engage himſelf to fight (though the enemy turn head) unleſſe he ſee his Captain and Lieutenant in great danger: and then he ſhall couragiouſly charge the enemy, to give time to thoſe of his company to

                     </note> In marching, ſome horſe muſt be ſent out a good way before, by the right way and the by-wayes, to diſcover whether there be no ambuſh of the enemies: And indeed, to be the better aſſured of the good ſucceſſe of an ambuſh, it ſhould be accompanied with ſome new and extraordinary invention.</p>
                  <p>If the Chief of a frontier garriſon will attempt to endammage the enemy by an ambuſh, being inferiour in ſtrength to the enemy, he muſt gather together ſo many of the troops of his neighbour garriſons, untill he be ſuperiour. And by making embuſcadoes two or three times in this manner, it will terrifie the enemy; in ſo much as that it may be conjectured, that though afterward he make embuſcadoes with fewer horſe, the enemy will not hazard to come forth, and ſo he may the ſafelier take booty. When the army marcheth, there is uſually ſome Cavallry left behind in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoe in ſome eminent place, from whence they may diſcover farre off, by that means to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the enemies Cavallry, which uſually is ſent to charge the rear of the marching army, to take ſome priſoners, or to get intelligence. But theſe muſt not go to their place of ambuſh by the right way, but having paſſed the place, they muſt return to it by ſome by way, leſt the enemy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them, diſcover them by their footing.</p>
                  <p>To employ all the Cavallry (ſuppoſed to be 4000, in fourty troops) in embuſcadoe, three troops muſt be ſent before towards the enemy, under an able Commander, giving notice onely to him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40349:29"/> and the Captains where the embuſcadoe ſhall be; and letting none of the ſouldiers know that any more horſe are to follow them, leſt any of them (in the enemies charge) being taken priſoner, ſhould reveal it to the enemy. Of theſe three troops, one hundred are to be ſent to the enemies camp, <hi>viz.</hi> fifty Cuiraſſiers with their Captain and Lieutenant, and fifty Harquebuſiers with their Lieutenant.

In view of theſe Harquebuſiers, at the diſtance of a canon ſhot, 25 Cuiraſſiers muſt make <hi>Alto,</hi> under command of their Lieutenant, to receive thoſe 25 Harquebuſiers when they return with booty. The Captain, with the other 25 Cuiraſſiers and 25 Harquebuſiers ſhall keep behind ſome half league off, divided into two troops; the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebubuſiers being placed neareſt the enemy in convenient manner, partly to ſuccour the ſaid fifty horſe (which likely will be charged by the horſe of the enemies guards) and alſo to make their retreat, wherein the Cuiraſſiers are of principall uſe. Theſe foure troops muſt ſtill retreat in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſtance one from another, one of them ſtill turning face to the enemie; unleſſe the enemy ſo charge them as they muſt be forced to flie in diſorder. The other 200 horſe (being 150 Cuiraſſiers, and 50 Harquebuſiers) ſhall enter the embuſcadoe, with their Chief, about half an houres riding off from the other fifty horſe; which when they ſee returning and charged, they ſhall iſſue out: the fifty Harquebuſiers firſt giving a charge rank after rank, then the Cuiraſſiers, leaving twenty horſe in the rear to make the retreat.</p>
                  <p>The groſſe (which had taken another way, leſt the enemie ſhould perceive by the footing that there was a greater number, and ſo ſhould ſtay or turn back) muſt be in ambuſh about an houres march behind the ſaid 200 horſe.

                  <p>According to this proportion, a greater or ſmaller number may be ordered, ſo as, if you would make an embuſcadoe with 100 horſe onely, 50 of them muſt be ſent before towards the enemies camp, or village where he is quartered. Of theſe fiftie, fifteen are to advance before the reſt, to take ſome priſoners or horſes: the other thirtiefive ſhall be in ambuſh about half a league behind them, in ſome place (if it be poſſible) whence they may ſee thoſe fifteen: but if not, then to place two horſe between themſelves and thoſe fifteen, to give notice when the ſaid fifteen ſhall return charged. Whereupon twentiefive (of theſe thirtiefive) ſhall advance, leaving ten of the beſt mounted at the place, to let the enemie ſee there is a greater number of horſe.

Theſe, ſeeing the firſt fiftie return charged, ſhall let them paſſe, and then iſſue out againſt the enemie: the firſt fiftie (making their retreat by twelve or fifteen of their beſt mounted horſe-men) having reunited themſelves and taken breath, they muſt make<note n="h" place="margin">The word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> or <hi>Alte,</hi> is uſed in all languages in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to make a ſtand.

The retreat ſhall be by the ſame way you went, ſo long as day continues; but night being come, you muſt take ſome other way (though the longer) to return to your garriſon, or quarter. Thus you ſhall gain time by turning away from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by the benefit of the night; cauſing the footing of your horſes to be defaced at the place where you left the way; for it is to be ſuppoſed the enemie will follow you by the direct way. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or put out the footing of the horſe, if the way be duſtie, two ſouldiers are appointed to ſtay behind all the reſt, which draw a great bough between them along the ground, and ſo put out the marks of the horſes footing. Or if there be a great number of horſe, and the way be broad, then foure ſouldiers with two boughs do it. But if the way be ſoft, the Chief commandeth five or ſix ſouldiers to alight, and with their hands and feet to deface the footings; and in ſuch wayes the horſe are commanded to march with doubled files, and cloſed, for a little ſpace when they turn out of the uſuall way, that ſo they may trample the leſſe. Beſides, you may avoid the danger of being traced by the horſe footings (eſpecially in the night) by turning out of the way at ſome houſe, or through ſome garden, breaking the hedge on the further ſide, and going into the way by wayes unthought of: by all which means you gain time, whileſt the enemie is conſtrained to ſpend time in diſcovering of your footing, and taking information of the way that you took.</p>

                  <p>IT hath been ſhewed how neceſſarie it is, that the Corporall which is ſent out with the ſcouts or diſcoverers, be a very able ſouldier, to know what to do upon occaſion of unexpected accidents. One or more troops of horſe being on their march, with their diſcoverers before them, if they ſhall meet the enemie, and perceive him to be the ſtronger, the ſaid Corporall ſhall preſently ſend a ſouldier to certifie the groſſe, that they may retreat: himſelf with his ſcouts alſo retreating, but by differing wayes. For ſuppoſe the enemie hath received tidings of his contrarie partie, it is likely that (having diſcovered the ſaid ſcouts) he will follow them, perſwading himſelf that they flie to their groſſe: by which means the groſſe ſhall have time to ſave themſelves, while the enemie is purſuing the ſaid Corporall and his fellows.</p>
                  <p>When the enemie is much ſtronger, and the other partie have neither time nor convenience to put themſelves into good order; the Chief ſhall call with a loud voice, and command every man to<note n="a" place="margin">Quintus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius pulſus acie à Quinto Metello pio, nè fugam qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſibi tutam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratus, milites diſperſos abire juſſit, admonitos in quem locum vellet convenire. <hi>Frontin.

                  <p>It is alſo to be done by the Carracoll firſt, and then (the enemie being within you) to wheel to the right and left inward, and ſo to charge him on the rear, in full career.

The Harquebuſiers muſt be exerciſed to give fire by ranks.

                  <p>A Commander having intelligence of ſome groſſe of the enemies Infanterie, and reſolving to ſet upon them, he muſt principally aim to encounter them in a place of advantage for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallrie, that is, in an<note n="a" place="margin">Si equitatu gaudemus, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos debemus opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; ſi pedite, loca deligere anguſta, foſſis; paludibus, vel arboribus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedita. <hi>Veg. lib. 3 cap. 9.</hi>
                     </note> open champain. He muſt alſo uſe all poſſible diligence to charge them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be ordered for battel, though they exceed him much for number.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſaid Infanterie be put in good order at his approch, (if the ground be champain, and the number equall) yet may they be charged by the horſe: Firſt by ſome troops of Harquebuſiers (or rather Dragons, becauſe they do execution at a larger diſtance) which ſhall give on on their front, flanks, and rear. Theſe were to be ſeconded by the Lances (in ſmall diviſions) when they were in uſe; but now by the Cuiraſſiers, who ſhall make their benefit of ſuch overtures or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as ſhall be cauſed by the ſaid Dragons and Harquebuſiers.</p>
                  <p>If the Infanterie exceed in number, and ſo be ſerried in a groſſe bodie, it will be hard for the Cavallrie to rout them, as hath been found by experience by the Swiſſes, which ſtill had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the horſe, by the reaſon of their groſſe bodies of pikes.</p>
                  <p>If the Infanterie be ordered into ſeverall battaillons, the horſe are to charge them where they perceive them moſt open and naked. But if the foot have poſſeſſed themſelves of ſome place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as ſome wood, trench, or covert way, then the horſe are not to charge them; though equall, or ſomewhat ſuperiour to them in number, in reſpect of ſuch advantage.</p>

                  <p>THe forms of battel uſed among the horſe (preſuppoſing ſuch as are made by election, in a free and ſpacious champain, and not ſuch as are forced through diſcommoditie of place, or other reſpects)<note n="a" place="margin">Ordinaturus aciem, ſolem &amp; ventum antè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpictat. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 14.</hi> Una aciei bellicae forma non eſt, ſed multa &amp; diverſa, pro varutate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum, militum, hostium, locorum, temporum. <hi>Leo Tact. c. 20. 182.</hi>
                     </note> are many; and do varie according to the ground and ſtrength both of your own ſide and the enemies, accidents, and occaſions. In all forms a principall care muſt be had, that the troops be drawn up from an even front, that ſo they may be free from diſturbing each other in the retreat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſta</hi> reduceth theſe forms to foure ſorts, and <hi>Melzo</hi> to three, (making the ſecond and third to be as one and the ſame) which are theſe:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, when the troops are ordered as in one file, every troop following each other in a ſingle order: which form is utterly diſallowed, becauſe it bringeth but few hands to fight, and the diſordering of the firſt troop muſt needs endanger all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, when all the troops are placed as in<note n="b" place="margin">Si nimiùm fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit acies attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, cuò ab adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariis factâ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſione perrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur, &amp; nullum poſtea poteſt eſſe remedium. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 16.</hi>
                     </note> one rank, or one front; the one troop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed on the flank of the other in a ſingle order or ſtraight line. Which form is alſo diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, becauſe in it all the Cavallrie is engaged at once, the one not being able to ſuccour the other, and having no troops of<note n="c" place="margin">The Grecians had their troops of reſerve, and herein the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated them, and theſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. <hi>Veg. ibid. cap.</hi> 17.</note> reſerve.</p>
                  <p>The third is, when the troops are ordered checquer-wiſe, in ſquadrous, enterchangeaby placed one behind another: ſo as three or foure ſquadrons being in front, ſuch diſtances are left between each, as others behind them may come up to the front, without hindering the former.<note n="d" place="margin">

                           </expan> tutus est.</hi> Leo Tact. cap. 9. 34. The Grecians had three kinds of horſe-battels; The Square, the Wedge, and the Rhombe (which is as the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond battel.) The Square was held the beſt for the defenſive, the other two for the offenſive. Of theſe the Wedge is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, becauſe it bringeth moſt hands to fight; the rear diviſion of the Rhombe being of little uſe. <hi>Aelian. cap</hi> 18.</note> This form may well be allowed of, and is retained by the beſt Commanders in the preſent warres of Chriſtendome: yet the forenamed authours have this exception to it, becauſe the Harquebuſiers having taken up the ſaid diſtances would hinder the Lances then in uſe. And if they ſhould be drawn from thoſe intervalles, and placed on the wings, they muſt be expoſed to the firſt aſſaults of the enemie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth kind of forms, they make the Lunarie, reſembling a half moon: but in this they differ from each other in the manner. That which they call ſingle, muſt needs be weak, their double form is better. But both theſe laſt forms (the Checquer, and the Lunarie form) ſhall be more fully repreſented in figure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walhauſen</hi> maketh ſix ſorts of battels: namely, 1. The Lunarie. 2. The checquer. 3. The Broad-fronted. 4. The Embowed. 5. The Sharp-pointed. 6. The Divided.</p>
                  <p>The Lunarie (as he makes it, and the figure, <hi>Fig.</hi> 8. <hi>Part</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. ſheweth it) is good, and indeed better then that of <hi>Baſta;</hi> but is improperly called the Lunarie form: for it is rather a Hollow, or Open-fronted wedge, like <hi>Aelians</hi>

                     <hi>Coelembolos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Checquer is as the forementioned; and allowable.</p>
                  <p>His Broad-fronted is alſo not to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>His Embowed (which by the name ſhould be a Convex half moon, like<note n="f" place="margin">Which the Latine tranſlation termeth <hi>Acies incurva;</hi> Aelian. cap. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>Aelians Cyrte</hi>) he maketh a meer wedge. The form is not the worſe, though the name be not ſo proper.</p>
                  <p>The Sharp-pointed (in regard there is but one troop in front, and that ſeconded but by two troops on the rear angles; then but one troop again, ſeconded as the firſt) ſeemeth not to be ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40349:32"/> good as the former, becauſe it bringeth few hands to fight, and is very ſubject to be<note n="g" place="margin">Whereof <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſheweth the inconveniences, <hi>cap.</hi> 50.</note> overwinged or overfronted by the enemie, and ſo to be charged on the flanks.</p>
                  <p>The Divided, eſpecially at ſo large a diſtance, I hold to be dangerous. True it is, that here the Dragons are uſed as foot, but whether ſo ſingle and ſo extended an order be the beſt for them to be placed in, I referre to the judicious.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning theſe ſix kinds of battels, they are in deed and in effect but two: that is, the Checquer and the Lunarie, as he calleth them; and from theſe grounds the reſt be formed.</p>
                  <p>But theſe forms being onely imaginarie, and withall wanting that perfection (in many reſpects) which is required in reall battels, I ſhall now (to give fuller ſatisfaction to ſuch as are lovers of militarie knowledge) communicate ſome forms of embattelings, which never yet were publiſhed by any.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are true delineations of divers battels really ordered and performed by the abſoluteſt Commanders of our times, according to the exacteſt rules of art; and ſuch as experience hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to be fitteſt for the modern warres.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding whereof, I have thought fit firſt to put down theſe directions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>All the forces of the whole armie (both horſe and foot) are uſually diſtinguiſhed and divided into<note n="h" place="margin">So did the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cornu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xirum,</hi> the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel <hi>Acies media,</hi> and the Rear <hi>Cornu ſiniſtrum;</hi> as is ſhewed by Sir <hi>Cl.

(as hath been ſhewed <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.) Each of which parts is governed by its particular Officer or Chief; yet ſo as the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command belongeth to the Generall. Theſe diſtinctions are alwayes ſo underſtood, in the order of marching, to avoid diſputes about precedencie; ſo as they which march formoſt are ſaid to have the Vanguard, they which march in the middle, the Battel, and they which come laſt the rear. And theſe diviſions alter their names according to the place they march in, wherein they obſerve a diurnall change, as hath been ſhewed in the chapter above mentioned. But if we ſhall take the meaning of theſe words (according to their proprietie and uſuall acceptation) in matter of fight or battel, conceiving that that part of the armie which is called the Vanguard ſhall give the firſt charge; and that which is called the Battel, ſhall give the ſecond charge, and the Rearward, the laſt; it will prove a meer miſtake. For we are to know that the firſt charge muſt be given by the firſt troop, or foremoſt orders of companies which are in front placed as in one rank, extended from the one front-angle of the whole armie, to the other: and ſo it were impoſſible for them to be commanded or directed by one Commander, or Chief of one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſquadron of the armie, by reaſon of the large extent thereof: for we ſee that the front of the armie embattelled before <hi>Dornick. Figure</hi> 14. (which was farre inferiour to that of late, employed at the ſiedge of the <hi>Boſſch</hi>) took up<note n="i" place="margin">Six foot make a fathom, 100 fathomes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, ſeven fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs and a half, a mile.

                  <p>Beſides, if the Vanguard (as it is called) ſhould give the firſt charge, the Battel (which then muſt ſecond them) may chance to be of a nation not onely differing from the Vanguard, but at variance with them, or elſe ſome grudge or diſguſt between the Chiefs. And in that reſpect they might either neglect or ſlacken the ſeconding or relieving of thoſe of the Vanguard, and not uſe that diligence which is required. In conſideration therefore of theſe and other inconveniences, it is beſt that every ſquadron of the army be ſo ordered as each of them may have their firſt ſecond, and third troops: by which means every diviſion ſhall both be commanded by their own Chiefs, and ſhall alſo be ſeconded by thoſe of their own ſquadron, or diviſion, which will give them the more courage and aſſurance. The manner therefore for the ordering of an army for battel, is as followeth; That ſquadron which is called the Battel, is placed in the middle, the Vanguard on the right hand of it, and the Rear on the left: and all theſe (uſually) in one front and ſingle order; one regiment (or ſometimes one company, eſpecially among the horſe, as <hi>Figure</hi> 10.) flanking the other, as in <hi>Figure</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>From hence the firſt troop of every diviſion is drawn up, and placed in an even front or ſtraight line, from one angle of the body to the other. At a convenient<note n="k" place="margin">Uſually 300 foot.</note> diſtance behind theſe, the ſecond troop of every ſquadron is placed, in an even rank, as the former; but ſo as the<note n="l" place="margin">The Romanes alſo ordered their battels in three diviſions, or troops: <hi>viZ.</hi> their <hi>Haſtati, Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
